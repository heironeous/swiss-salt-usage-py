# swiss-salt-usage-py
python Obtain usage statistics of Swiss Mobile Provider Salt 

# Why

Swiss mobile provider had an app that would show you the usage statistics about your phone, but the app stopped working, and they removed it from the app store.

This is an initiative to write a similar app. Since I'd like to increase my python knowledge, this will all be written in python. App and everything.

# How

This will simply do a HTML parse of the elements from the website, so no REST API calls, only simple GET and POST calls to the HTTPS enpoints. 

The app is planned to be written in [BeeWare](https://beeware.org/). Since I'm still learning how to use beeware, the project might go away from Beeware.
